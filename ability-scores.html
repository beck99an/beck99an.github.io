		<h1 class='page-header'>Ability Scores, Basic Stats and Proficiencies</h1>

		<p>Your ability scores (the raw number, i.e. 14) and ability modifiers (the bonus, i.e. the +2) are fairly straightforward. I made no changes here.</p>
		
		<p>Your proficiency score is a flat bonus that you apply in a number of places. Your proficiency bonus goes up by one every fourth level - race and class don't matter.</p>
		<p>So, beginning at level 5, this bonus will be +3 for everyone</p>
		
		<p>Your proficiency bonus is added to the skills you're proficient in. You get skill proficiencies from 3 places (see p. 15 PHB also):
		<li>Your background</li>
		<li>Your race</li>
		<li>Your class</li>
		
		<p>In Boz's case, she should have been proficient in persuasion based on her Guild Artisan background so that was added to the final sheet</p>
		
		<p>I wrote out the bonus that applies to each skill check - you probably don't need to as it's just "Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus if proficient" but it's easy enough and a handy reference</p>
		
		<p>I added Boz's passive perception to the sheet. Passive skills - that is, your baseline, not making a particular effort level of skill - for any skill is "10 + skill modifier (see p. 175 PHB)"</p>
		<p>So, for Boz, that's 10 + 0. Worry if Boz is on watch alone.</p>
