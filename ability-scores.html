		<h1 class='page-header'>Ability Scores, Basic Stats and Proficiencies</h1>

		<p>Ability scores (the raw number, i.e. 14) and ability modifiers (the bonus, i.e. the +2) should be straightforward. Boz's are all good as far as I know so I made no changes here.</p>
		
		<h3>Passive Perception</h3>
		
		<p>I added Boz's passive perception to the sheet. The most commonly used passive skill is passive perception so it's given it's own spot on the character sheet.</p>
		<p>Generally, passive skills - that is, your baseline, not making a particular effort level of skill - for any skill is "10 + skill modifier (see p. 175 PHB)"</p>
		<p>So, for Boz, she is not proficient in perception, and her Wisdom modifier is 0. So that's 10 + 0. Worry if Boz is on watch alone.</p>
		
		<h3>Proficiency</h3>
		
		<p>Your proficiency score is a flat bonus that you apply in a number of places. Your proficiency bonus goes up by one every fourth level - race and class don't matter.</p>
		<p>So, beginning at level 5, this bonus will be +3 for everyone.</p>
		
		<p>Your proficiency bonus is added to any ability check - skills, tools or attacks generally - that you're proficient in. You get skill proficiencies from 3 places (see p. 15 PHB also):
		<li>Your background</li>
		<li>Your race</li>
		<li>Your class</li>
		
		<p>In Boz's case, she should have been proficient in persuasion based on her Guild Artisan background so that was added to the final sheet</p>
		
		<h3>Skills</h3>
		
		<p>I wrote out the bonus that applies to each skill check on the left hand of the sheet, beside the ability scores and ability modifiers.</p>
		<p>Like most changes, this one is about doing math now so you don't have to at the table.</p>
		<p>It's not hard math - just "Ability Modifier + (if proficient) Proficiency Bonus" - but why not make life as easy as possible?</p>
		
		<h3>Other uses of Proficiency</h3>
		
		<p>Your proficiency bonus is added in three other very common circumstances:
		<li>Your chance to hit with a weapon you are proficient with</li>
		<li>Your chance to hit with a spell that requires a spell attack</li>
		<li>Your Spell (or Skill) Save DC</li>
		
		<p>In the first two cases, just like with skills, you add your proficiency bonus to your ability modifier to get your total bonus.</p>
		<p>Again, like with skills, you don't have to write this out, but you can see in the middle column of Boz's completed sheet that her attack bonus with daggers is +2 proficiency plus +1 Dex = +3</p>
		<p>Below that, her spell attack modifier is +2 prof plus +3 Int (her spellcasting ability) = +5. More on spellcasting later.
		
		<p>For Spellcasters, your Spell Save DC is what the bad guys have to roll to save against your spells.</p>
		<p>Your Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting modifier. For Boz, her Spell Save DC is 8 + 2 (prof bonus) + 3 (Int modifier) = 13.
		<p>Other classes might also have skills that require bad-guys to make a saving throw. Both Wellebe and Volen, for example, have abilities like this. I'd put my skill save DC on the sheet in the Spell Save DC spot for ease of reference</p>
		<p>Their Skill Save DC is calculated the same way - your class chapter has the details for which ability score applies.</p>
