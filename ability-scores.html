		<h1 class='page-header'>Ability Scores, Basic Stats and Proficiencies</h1>

		<p>Your ability scores (the raw number, i.e. 14) and ability modifiers (the bonus, i.e. the +2) are fairly straightforward. I made no changes here.</p>
		
		<p>Your proficiency score is a flat bonus that you apply in a number of places. Your proficiency bonus goes up by one every fourth level - race and class don't matter.</p>
		<p>So, beginning at level 5, this bonus will be +3 for everyone</p>
		
		<p>Your proficiency bonus is added to the skills you're proficient in. You get skill proficiencies from 3 places (see p. 15 PHB also):
		<li>Your background</li>
		<li>Your race</li>
		<li>Your class</li>
		
		<p>In Boz's case, she should have been proficient in persuasion based on her Guild Artisan background so that was added to the final sheet</p>
		
		<p>I wrote out the bonus that applies to each skill check - you may not need to as it's just "Ability Modifier + (if proficient) Proficiency Bonus" but why not make life even easier</p>
		
		<p>Your proficiency bonus is added in two other very common circumstances: your chance to hit with a weapon you are proficient with
		<li>Your chance to hit with a weapon you are proficient with</li>
		<li>Your chance to hit with a spell that requires a spell attack</li>
		
		<p>In both cases, just like with skills, you add your proficiency bonus to your ability modifier to get your total bonus.</p>
		<p>Again, like with skills, you don't have to write this out, but you can see in the middle column of Boz's completed sheet that her attack bonus with daggers is +3 (+2 prof, +1 Dex).</p>
		<p>Below that, her spell attack modifier is +5 (+2 prof, +3 Int modifier). More on spellcasting later.
		
		<p>I added Boz's passive perception to the sheet. Passive skills - that is, your baseline, not making a particular effort level of skill - for any skill is "10 + skill modifier (see p. 175 PHB)"</p>
		<p>So, for Boz, she is not proficient in perception, and her Wisdom modifier is 0. So that's 10 + 0. Worry if Boz is on watch alone.</p>
