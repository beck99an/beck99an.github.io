		<p>Your Features and Traits are generally the things that allow your character to break the general rules of the game in fun and interesting ways.</p>
		<p>Because of this, I think it's worth including as much as possible on your sheet.</p>
		
		<p>For Boz, I've added a lot more detail on the right hand side of the sheet but in shorthand. I've included fuller descriptions of those abilities on the second page.</p>
		<p>As a Tiefling, Boz has resistance to fire - I moved the statement from the features section on page 1 and filled in the bubble beside "fire" and under the R for resistance in the top right of the sheet.</p>
		<p>Her "Infernal Legacy" feature allows her to know the Thaumaturgy cantrip so it was added to her spell page. It also allows her to cast Hellish Rebuke once per long rest.</p>
		<p>Although that's a spell, I've not put it on the spell page as it doesn't follow Boz's normal spellcasting rules. I've included it with the features instead, with a reference to the page number in the PHB.</p>
		<p>For "Infernal Legacy" powers, Boz uses her Charisma instead of Intelligence for her spell save DC and spell attack modifier.</p>
		<p>Since her Charisma and Intelligence are both 16, that's a distinction without a difference but might matter later if those stats change.</p>
		
		<p>I used the second page to include more detail on her background feature, "Guild Membership", which allows her to get assistance, political contacts, and other aid from her guild.</p>
		<p>Since that's not a feature you're likely to need on a combat turn, I think it doesn't need a mention on the first page.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, similar to the "Infernal Legacy" feature, as a wizard in the school of enchantment, Boz has the hypnotic gaze feature, which I've shorthanded on page 1 and fully copied on page 2</p>
		
		<p>Again, the idea with all of this is to make it easy to see the things you can do at a glance. Clerics can turn undead. Paladins can lay on hands. Fighters can get a second wind.</p>
		<p>Having these skills - or at least a shorthand and page reference to the PHB - will make it more likely that you'll remember to use them and easier to use them when you do!</p>
