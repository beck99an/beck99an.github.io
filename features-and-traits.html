		<p>Your Features and Traits are generally the things that allow your character to break the general rules of the game in fun and interesting ways.</p>
		<p>Because of this, I think it's worth including as much as possible on your sheet. These are the rules your DM is least likely to know and the ones that make your character unique.</p>
		
		<p>For Boz, I've added a lot more detail on the right hand side of the sheet but in shorthand. I've included more complete descriptions of each feature listed there on the second page.</p>
		
		<p>As a Tiefling, Boz has resistance to fire. Immunities, resistances and vulnerabilities have their own box at the top right. I deleted the statement from the features section and filled in the fire resistance bubble at top-right.</p>
		
		<p>Boz's "Infernal Legacy" feature allows her to know the Thaumaturgy cantrip, so it was added to her spell page as a cantrip.
		
		<p>The same feature also allows her to cast Hellish Rebuke once per long rest.</p>
		<p>Although that's a spell, I've not put it on the spell page as it doesn't follow Boz's normal spellcasting rules. I've included it with the features instead, with a reference to the page number in the PHB.</p>
		
		<p>For "Infernal Legacy" powers, Boz uses her Charisma instead of Intelligence for her spell save DC and spell attack modifier.</p>
		<p>Since her Charisma and Intelligence are both 16, that's a distinction without a difference but might matter later if those stats change.</p>
		
		<p>I used the second page to include more detail on her background feature, "Guild Membership", which allows her to get assistance, political contacts, and other aid from her guild.</p>
		<p>Since that's a feature you're more likely to need in a social setting than on a combat turn, I didn't think it required a mention on the first page.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, similar to the "Infernal Legacy" feature, as a wizard in the school of enchantment, Boz has the hypnotic gaze feature. I've shorthanded it on page 1 and fully copied it on page 2.</p>
		
		<p>Again, the idea with all of this is to make it easy to see the things you can do at a glance. Clerics can turn undead. Paladins can lay on hands. Fighters can get a second wind.</p>
		<p>Having these skills - or at least a shorthand and page reference to the PHB - will make it more likely that you'll remember to use them and easier to use them when you do!</p>
