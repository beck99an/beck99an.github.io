		<p>Here's Boz's character sheet before:

		<img src='/2-page-2-before.jpg'/>
		<img src='/3-page-3-before.jpg'/>
		
		<p>And here it is post-Audit:</p>
		
		<p>All these changes should hopefully make Louisa's life a litte easier at the table.</p>
		<p>I'll explain the changes I made section-by-section and, hopefully, enough of it will be general advice that you can apply to your own sheet</p>

		<h3>Really basic stuff</h3>

		<p>The top section of the sheet is, obviously, not complicated and I didn't make any changes there. I did note that Boz has no last name!</p>
		<p>That's either an interesting story waiting to be told or an oversight - Louisa can decide what Boz's biography is and whether a last name is part of it.</p>
