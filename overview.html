		<p>All these changes should hopefully make Louisa's life a litte easier at the table.</p>
		<p>I'll explain the changes I made section-by-section and, hopefully, enough of it will be general advice that you can apply to your own sheet.</p>

		<h3>Really basic stuff</h3>

		<p>The top section of the sheet is, obviously, not complicated and I didn't make any changes there. I did note that Boz has no last name!</p>
		<p>That's either an interesting story waiting to be told or an oversight - Louisa can decide what Boz's biography is and whether a last name is part of it.</p>
		
		<h3>Armour Class</h3>
		
		<p>15, huh? :)</p>
		<p>Your AC, with no armour or shield, is 10 + your Dex modifier. Boz's Dex modifier is 1 so her AC, without shield or armour is 11.</p> 
		<p>She has a Staff of Defense that was seized pursuant to a medieval civil forfeiture code that grants +1 AC while holding it. So Boz's AC is 12 if the glass staff is in hand</p>
		<p>So I wrote 12 in the box - I assume Boz will mostly have that staff in hand. We'll all have to remember it drops by one if she drops the staff. We'll definitely have to remember Boz does not have a 15 AC.</p>
		<p>(sidebar, for Louisa's honour, I assume that she wrote the AC as if she'd cast mage armour, which would bring her AC to 15. That info is in shorthand on the first page and fully spelled out on the second).</p>
		
		<h3>Magic Items</h3>
		<p>As just mentioned, Boz has a magical glass staff - the Staff of Defense - which grants certain abilities. I've included a shorthand version of those abilities on page 1 and fully spelled out the staff's powers on page 2.</p>
