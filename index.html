			<p>I asked Blizzard to make us a legendary jersey. I said: Blizzard quality concept and design, too.</p>
			<p>Of course they agreed. If you check the timestamp on this, I'm pretty sure they got the idea for OWL jerseys from me.</p>
			<p>They ran with the name "Friendly Fire" and came up with this D-Day inspired Jersey.</p>
			<p>Camo of course - to blend in on the flanks - and then black and white stripes on the arms to identify the player as friendly. Just like Allied planes on D-Day!</p>
			<p>I thought it was a pretty cool concept.</p>
			<p>At the very least we've avoided Jersocalypse II.</p>
