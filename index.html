		<p class='centered-text'>Louisa was kind enough to post her recently updated character sheet for Boz. I had a few ideas about how it could be improved so that as much information as possible is just "at-hand". Louisa kindly agreed to let me post the results! </p>

		<h3>A Brief Note Before Diving In</h3>
		<p>This is very much a "what I would do if" review. It isn't by any stretch the right way or best way. If you find some of it useful, great.</p>
		<p>The whole philosophy could be summed up as follows: what can I do to limit the number of times I need to do math or open the PHB during a session?</p>
		<p>So, hopefully you find some of the below helpful, and I present it in the hope that it reduces frustration and increases fun at the table!</p>
