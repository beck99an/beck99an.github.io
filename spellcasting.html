		<h3>Spellcasting Generally</h3>
		
		<p>Spellcasting rules are at p. 201 of the PHB but here's the quick and dirty. There are three kinds of spells:</p>
		<li>Spells that just work</li>
		<li>Spells that require you to make an attack</li>
		<li>Spells that require the target to make a saving throw</li>
		
		<p>So, to effectively sling spells, you need to know:</p>
		<li>in all three cases, what the spell does</li>
		<li>In the second case, what to add to your attack roll</li>
		<li>In the third case, what type saving throw the target has to make (i.e. Wisdom, Dexterity, etc.), and the number they must match or beat (i.e. the Difficulty Clas or DC)</li>
		
		<p>On Boz's sheet, I've put the last two pieces of information in two places - on the first page the Spell Attack modifier and Spell Save DC are in the middle of the page.</p>
		<p>Just above that are two attacking cantrips with brief shorthand descriptions. Beside acid splash, I've noted that it requires a Dex save, and beside Shocking Grasp, I noted it's a melee spell attack.</p>
		
		<p>On page 3 of Boz's sheet, I've added shorthand info to each spell, including the two cantrips listed on page 1.</p>
		
		<p>For every spell I've noted its page in the PHB so the "what the spell does" piece is easy to find.</p>
		
		<p>Generally, I assume each spell requires 1 action to cast. For spells that have a different casting time, I've noted it (i.e. Misty Step is Bonus Action). This is handy for seeing at a glance which spells are actually options in a given situation.</p>
		<p>I've also noted any spell that can be cast as a ritual for the same reason. Can I save a spell slot out of combat? Check if it's a ritual.</p>
		
		<p>On both the first page and the spell sheet, I've noted how many spell slots Boz has - as a 3rd level wizard, she has 4 first level and 2 second level slots available.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, on rereading the book, I noted that wizards can choose 2 additional spells of a level they can cast to add to their spell book for free each time they level up.</p>
		<p>So, bonus for Louisa, you can pick 2 additional first level spells and two additional first or second level spells to add, for free!</p>

		<p>Finally, as Boz - like Thordin and Yilthir - knows more spells than she's able to prepare to cast in a day, I would be using the pips on the left hand to indicate which spells I'd prepared each day.</p>
		
		<p>There's more to spellcasting than I've covered here - I haven't touched the Verbal, Somatic and Material requirements of spells, for example, but those are rules that are easy to cover at the table and generally speaking don't limit you unless, you know, a bad guy casts silence or you have to cast a spell with your hands tied.</p>
		<p>The PHB page number is always there in those cases.</p>
